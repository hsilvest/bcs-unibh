	involving specific machinery constraints and actual cutting production
	industry requirements. To adapt the problem to a wider range of machinery
	characteristics, the design objective considers the minimisation

	patterns. The number of cuts required for the cutting process is
	crucial for the life of the industrial machines and is an important
	aspect in determining the cost and efficiency of the cutting operation.
	In this paper we propose the application of evolutionary algorithms
	to address the multi-objective problem, for which numerous approaches
	to its single-objective formulation exist, but for which multi-objective
	approaches are almost non-existent. The multi-objective evolutionary
	algorithms applied provide a set of solutions offering a range of
	trade-offs between the two objectives from which clients can choose
	according to their needs. By considering both the length and number
	of cuts, they derive solutions with wastage levels similar to most
	previous approximations which just seek to optimise the overall length.},

  abstract = {In industrial cutting operations the number of cutting patterns needed
	to satisfy a given set of orders may be crucial for the capacity
	load which can be achieved for the cutting equipment, since switching
	between different patterns often necessitates time-consuming set-ups.
	Therefore, in planning the cutting operations, one does not necessarily
	search for input-minimal cutting plans (i.e. cutting plans minimizing
	material costs) only, but also for plans with a small (or even minimal)
	number of cutting patterns. Such plans are usually generated in a
	two-step approach: in a first step, regardless of the number of patterns
	needed, an inputminimal cutting plan is generated while in a second
	step the number of patterns is reduced. In this paper a new method
	for the second step is presented, which can be considered as a generalization
	of other methods previously suggested for this purpose. The performance
	of the new method is evaluated on the basis of 1800 randomly generated
	problem instances. The solution quality of the new method turns out
	to be clearly superior to the existing methods, however, an increase
	in computing times occurs for some problem classes. In this case
	it is possible to speed up the proposed method considerably at the
	expense of a slight decrease in solution quality.},

	In earlier papers [Opns. Res. 9, 849–859 (1961), and 11, 863–888 (1963)]
	the one-dimensional cutting stock problem was discussed as a linear
	programming problem. There it was shown how the difficulty of the
	enormous number of columns occurring in the linear programming formulation
	could be overcome by solving a knapsack problem at every pivot step.
	In this paper higher dimensional cutting stock problems are discussed
	as linear programming problems. The corresponding difficulty of the
	number of columns cannot in general be overcome for there is no efficient
	method for solving the generalized knapsack problem of the higher
	dimensional problem. However a wide class of cutting stock problems
	of industry have restrictions that permit their generalized knapsack
	problem to be efficiently solved. All of the cutting stock problems
	that yield to this treatment are ones in which the cutting is done
	in stages. In treating these practical cutting problems, one often
	encounters additional conditions that affect the solution. An example
	of this occurs in the cutting of corrugated boxes, which involves
	an auxiliary sequencing problem. This problem is discussed in some
	detail, and a solution described for the sequencing problem under
	given simplifying assumptions.},

	The cutting-stock problem is the problem of filling an order at minimum
	cost for specified numbers of lengths of material to be cut from
	given stock lengths of given cost. When expressed as an integer programming
	problem the large number of variables involved generally makes computation

	This paper develops a formulation of the one-dimensional trim problem
	when there is a fixed charge associated with using a cutting pattern.
	The purpose of the fixed charge is to limit the number of pattern
	changes that must be made. Because of the large number of possible
	cutting patterns, the resulting problem is a combinatorial program
	that is far beyond the capability of existing algorithms. As a result,
	we develop a heuristic procedure that can be experimentally tuned
	to balance the potentially conflicting objectives of minimizing both
	trim loss and pattern changes. The heuristic procedure is organized
	around a sequential search that relies on descriptors of the unscheduled
	orders to set goals on factors such as trim loss and pattern usage
	for the next pattern to enter the solution. A sample problem is presented
	along with a discussion of the scope of the application of the heuristic
	procedure.},

	A wide variety of materials are manufactured in bulk by processes
	in which the dimensions of the units of production are constrained
	by the nature of the machinery being used. The assortment problem
	is that of deciding, given the constraints, what the dimensions of
	the production units should be. The trim-loss problem is that of
	formulating a scheme for the cutting of the production units into
	pieces of the sizes ordered by customers.
	
	
	A variety of methods, both exact and heuristic, have been applied
	to these problems. This paper presents a taxonomy of the problems
	and reviews the techniques which have been proposed for their solution.},

	The author of the work "Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning
	Production", Professor L. V. Kantorovich, is an eminent authority
	in the field of mathematics. This work is interesting from a purely
	mathematical point of view since it presents an original method,
	going beyond the limits of classical mathematical analysis, for solving
	extremal problems. On the other hand, this work also provides an
	application of mathematical methods to questions of organizing production
	which merits the serious attention of workers in different branches
	of industry.

	When producing window frames made out of aluminium one faces the decision
	problem to determine how many aluminium profiles of a given standard
	length have to be bought to fulfill production requirements. As results
	of the currently implemented First Fit Decreasing (FFD) heuristic
	were regarded unsatisfactorily, a new code—based on the column generation
	procedure of Gilmore and Gomory—has been developed and supplemented
	by a one-pass branching up procedure to achieve integrality. Algorithmic
	details about the integrality achievement phase as well as results
	obtained when solving real world cutting stock problems on a personal
	computer are provided.},
